# Elevate - Professional AI-Powered Portfolio

A world-class digital profile for **Hamid Idris Mussa**, Information Security Architect.

## 🛡️ Resilience & Fault Tolerance

This application is engineered to stay online even under degraded conditions:

- **Global Error Boundary**: Captures runtime crashes and offers a "System Repair" utility to clear corrupt local state.
- **Service Retries**: CMS and AI service calls implement exponential backoff to handle transient network failures.
- **Hardened Fallback**: If headless CMS endpoints are unreachable, the app automatically engages a pre-compiled, high-quality data set.
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time connection status in the footer keeps the user informed of service health.
- **Sanitized Errors**: UI-facing error messages are cleaned of technical jargon to maintain a premium brand image while providing actionable feedback.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Headless CMS Ready**: Async data layer with hardened local fallback.
- **AI Recruiter**: Gemini-powered assistant with context-aware logic.
- **Dynamic Localization**: Full English and Arabic (RTL) support.
- **Secure Architecture**: Designed with information security best practices in mind.
